if Object.const_defined?("Rich")
  Rich.setup do |config|    
    
    # == CKEditor configuration
    # 
    # Rich ships with what I hope are sensible defaults. 
    # You may want to override these.
    # 
    # For example, the elements available in the formats
    # dropdown are defined like this:
    #   config.editor[:formats] = ""
    # 
    # By default, Rich visualizes what type of element
    # you are editing. To disable this:
    #   config.editor[:startupOutlineBlocks] = false
    
    
    # == Image styles
    # 
    # Rich uses paperclip for image processing. You can
    # define the styles you would like to use here. You 
    # can use the standard syntax allowed by paperclip.
    # See: https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/wiki/Thumbnail-Generation
    # 
    # When you change these after uploading some files,
    # remember to do let Paperclip re-generate these by running
    #   rake paperclip:refresh CLASS=Rich::RichImage
    config.image_styles = {
      :thumb => "100x100#"
    }
    
    # == Allowed styles (in file manager)
    # 
    # Of the styles specified above, which should be user
    # selectable in the file manager?
    #
    # Example:
    #   config.allowed_styles = [ :large, :thumb ]
    #
    # Default:
    # config.allowed_styles = :all
    
    # == Default Style
    # 
    # The style to insert by default. In addition to the
    # styles defined above you can also use :original to get 
    # the unprocessed file. Make sure this style exists.
    config.default_style = :thumb

		# == Asset insertion
		#
		# Set this to true to keep the filebrowser open after inserting an asset.
		# Also configurable per-use from within the filebrowser.
		#
		# Default:
		# config.insert_many = false
    
    # == User Authentication
    #
    # When defined, Rich will automatically call this method
    # in a before filter to ensure that the user is logged in.
    # 
    # If you do not change this value from the default, anyone
    # will be able to see your images, and upload files.
    # 
    # Example for Devise with an AdminUser model:
    #   config.authentication_method = :authenticate_admin_user!
    # 
    # Default (NOT recommended in production environments): 
    # config.authentication_method = :none
    
  end
  
  Rich.insert
